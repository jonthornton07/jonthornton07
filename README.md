### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
If you've made it here you clearly know that I am a developer.  I enjoy writing code, I enjoy learning new things.  I spend most of my time leading teams across different Mobile platforms.
Currently I am working on a React Native project at NCR.  Leading a team across multiple timezones and pushing the boundaries with what React Native can do.

I spend most of my professional time doing
- React Native Typescript
- Swift
- Java

I enjoy dabbling in other technologies outside of work. 
- Personal website written in ReactJS but hosted in CGP in a K8s cluster.
- A front end architectural theory around how much code can we share on React Native + ReactJS projects.
- Udemy course on C# and ReactJS (mainly learning C#) and gaining exposure to back end concepts.
- Raspberry PIs

If you want to chat drop me a line via email or LinkedIn.  I am always looking to make connectons and chat about technology.
